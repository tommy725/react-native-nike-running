## Features

- FadedZoom Transition
  This will add forFadedZoom transition to react-navigation (you can use it on another project)

```
    transitionConfig: () => ({
      screenInterpolator: sceneProps => {
        return forFadedZoom(sceneProps);
      }
    })
```

- Swipeable Card
  The card can be swiped up-down to toggle hide and left-right to change current card view. Pan responder works smooth on the web ðŸ’ª

- Geolocation & Animated Marker
  The homescreen will show your current location with animated marker. For map the web now still fallback to image, need to work on the map component for RND.

- Box Shadow & Gradient
  (iOS only) There will be shadow around the button and cards. I do some tricky part to achieve the linear gradient. I use gradient image and use similar LinearGradient props:

```
if (Platform.OS != "dom") {
  var LinearGradient = require("react-native-linear-gradient").default;
} else {
  var LinearGradient = require("../components/LinearGradient").default;
}
```
